13&I was home alone and scared out of my %plural_noun~. I could hear the wind %verb_ing~, and off in the distance a(n) %noun~ was howling. I crossed the room, locked the %noun~, and climbed into bed, pulling the %plural_noun~ over my %body_part~. Then it happened. I could hear a(n) %noun~ %verb_ing~ up the stairs. My %body_part~ started to chatter and my knees began to %verb~. The %noun~ was thrust open and there was a huge %noun~ with hair all over his %body_part~. It was my father.&Afraid of the dark
13&The last time I went to a sleepover, a(n) %adjective~ pillow fight broke out. Out of nowhere, %name_female~ grabbed her %adjective~, fluffy %noun~ and began swinging it at anyone close to her. Soon, everyone else joined in! At one point, I got hit right in the back of my %body_part~. As soon as I recovered, I tossed my %noun~ at %name_female~'s %body_part~, but I missed. Instead, I knocked over an expensive %noun~ and my pillow split open! A bunch of %plural_noun~ flew everywhere, covering the room in a layer of %adjective~ feathers. The fighting stopped when we all broke out in %adjective~ laughter. The fun ended when we realized that we had to clean up the %adjective~ mess.&Pillow Fight!
